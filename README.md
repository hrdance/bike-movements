Python notebooks which generate an animated gif of public bike availability in Glasgow and Manchester over a given period.

The notebooks collect data from the relevant GBFS feed at a user specified frequency and for a user specified length of time.

Data is saved to csv files, then plots are created from these before combining the plots into an animated gif.

Code is included to automatically retrieve map data for use in the plots.

To use, simply ensure all necessary packages are installed, then set the runtime and interval prior to running.
